# D2D-communication
optimal mode selection between normal cellular and D2D  mode. 

MCMC_k_user.m is the main file to be run. This takes the input for No. of users, Power of each device, power emitted by the base station
and path loss exponent and generates a plot of the optimal mode selection for different users. 

The remaining two files are just saved workspaces for different configurations.
